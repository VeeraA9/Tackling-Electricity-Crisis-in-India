# Tackling-Electricity-Crisis-in-India
The aim of this study is to identify new solutions
for addressing and mitigating electricity scarcity problems through machine learning approaches. By
studying past consumption patterns, weather data and generation of electricity, an algorithm based on
machine learning may be able to anticipate demand changes, adjust energy distribution or enhance
overall grid efficiency. This research is focused on building predictive models that can accurately
estimate electricity consumption, which allows for early allocation of resources and grid management.
Additionally, to complement the current infrastructure of electricity generation, optimisation algorithms
will be applied to find out which locations are most suitable for renewables like solar and wind.
Realtime monitoring and control of the energy supply will be enhanced by combining Smart Grid
technology with Internet of Things devices providing greater flexibility in response to changing demand
patterns.
